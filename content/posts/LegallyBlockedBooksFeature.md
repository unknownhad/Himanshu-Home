Hello, readers!

We're thrilled to announce a new feature on LegallyBlocked: Blocked Books. This addition goes beyond our initial offering of blocked websites and applications, allowing you to discover which books are banned or restricted by governments worldwide.

In an era where information is power, censorship can act as a significant barrier to knowledge and understanding. Our aim with the Blocked Books feature is to shed light on this issue, showing you which texts are prohibited in different parts of the globe. Whether it's a novel, a history book, or a scientific text, we believe it's important to know what information is being restricted.

This feature, like the rest of our platform, is built on Cloudflare's technology stack. This ensures a fast, scalable, and reliable experience for all users. Our mission remains to make the internet a more open and accessibleplace for everyone, and Blocked Books is a step further in that direction.

Of course, our mission wouldn't be possible without the support of our amazing community. We invite you to explore this new feature and share your feedback with us. If you come across any inaccuracies or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at contact@legallyblocked.website.

Together, we can continue to shine a light on censorship and help ensure that everyone has access to the information they need. Stay tuned to our blog and follow us on Twitter for the latest updates and features.

Thank you for being part of our journey towards a more open and accessible internet!

Best,  
The Legally Blocked Team
